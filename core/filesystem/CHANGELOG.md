# @inkandswitch/patchwork-filesystem

## 0.2.5

### Patch Changes

- f00dcb8: Add `repository` metadata pointing at inkandswitch/patchwork-system, so npm links each package to its source directory and can attest provenance when published from CI.

## 0.2.4

### Patch Changes

- 5f70c14: Add `repository` metadata pointing at inkandswitch/patchwork-next, so npm links each package to its source directory and can attest provenance when published from CI.

## 0.2.3

### Patch Changes

- bd63259: Move module reload chatter to a `patchwork:modules` debug logger, and report module load failures with `console.error` instead of `console.log`.

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- caca06f: Remove branch support from modules, falling back to the default branch. Handle module-watcher instability. Drop the react and solid packages.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- bd9cd3d: Reliability and boot-speed fixes:

  - The service worker no longer blocks responses on cache writes (they move to
    `waitUntil`), page caching writes its three entries in parallel, non-GET
    requests bypass the worker entirely, cache-write failures (e.g. quota) are
    always logged, the cache is capped at 2000 entries with oldest-first
    trimming, and boot requests persistent storage so cache growth can't trip
    origin-wide eviction of user data.
  - `automerge.wasm` is fetched under one URL from both the tab and the
    automerge worker (the `?main`/`?worker` tracing query strings defeated the
    HTTP cache, the SW cache, and the sites' preload — the ~3MB body downloaded
    twice).
  - Tabs now recover when the automerge SharedWorker dies or its connection is
    stranded. Previously death was only logged and tabs silently stopped syncing
    until reload. Silence alone never tears anything down (a slow-booting or
    busy worker delivers everything queued once it catches up): a silent port
    first starts a non-destructive probe — a second connection to the same
    instance — and only when the probe gets a `hello` while the original port
    stays silent (proving a live instance with a stranded port) is the worker
    handle recreated, with sync-state subscriptions replayed and every
    subscriber's repo re-wired onto a fresh port. This rescues boots whose
    initial SharedWorker port comes up deaf (~6s), including in hidden
    background tabs; a port `close` event still recovers immediately.
  - The worker no longer rescans every doc handle on every
    `subduction-remote-heads` event (quadratic during sync bursts); it tracks
    just the reported doc.
  - `ModuleWatcher` announces are generation-tracked, so a stale retry of an
    older module version can no longer land after a newer version and roll the
    registry back.
  - `resolveAccountHandle` never overwrites a valid stored account pointer when
    `repo.find` fails: it retries briefly and then throws, instead of silently
    creating a fresh account and orphaning the user's workspace.
  - `OverlayRepo` no longer memoizes rejected resolutions: a `find` that failed
    because the doc (or its keyhive access) hadn't synced yet used to pin every
    later `find` of that url to the same cached rejection, so the views' "retry
    once access syncs" recovery could never reach the base repo. Rejections now
    evict and the next `find` re-resolves. `findWithProgress().subscribe` also
    no longer leaks its inner subscription (or fires the callback) when
    unsubscribed before the resolution settles.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 82bee46: A doc's `suggestedImportUrl` may now be an `automerge:` folder-doc URL as well
  as an `http(s):` module bundle. When a view finds no built-in tool for a doc, it
  loads the suggested module either way. Adds `importPackage` (which dispatches on
  the URL scheme) and `isImportableSuggestedUrl` to `patchwork-filesystem`, and
  `getSuggestedImportUrl` now honors automerge URLs.

  The package-importing helpers are renamed from `module` to `package`, since they
  resolve a `package.json` entry point: `importModuleFromFolderDocUrl` →
  `importPackageFromFolderDocUrl`, `importModuleFromHttpUrl` →
  `importPackageFromHttpUrl`, and the `ModuleWatcher` `importAutomergeModule` hook
  (with bootloader's `importAutomergeModuleViaWorker`) → `importAutomergePackage`.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- 0c6177a: An HTTP(S) module URL in a module-settings doc may now point at a site/directory that serves a `package.json` rather than straight at an entry file. When the URL doesn't already name a module file, its `package.json` is fetched and the entry point (`exports`/`main`) resolved and imported. URLs that already point directly at a file still import as-is.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 923ad66: Resolve importable URLs against `globalThis.document.baseURI` (falling back to `globalThis.origin`) so they are absolute rather than root-relative.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 099e931: Discover a package's plugin descriptors in a dedicated module worker off the
  main thread, then re-import the package (pinned to the same heads) on the main
  thread to run each plugin's real loader. Adds
  `importPluginFromFolderDocUrl(folderDocUrl, pluginType, pluginId)`, which selects
  the plugin by both its `type` and `id` — a plugin `id` is only unique within a
  plugin type, so a package may export e.g. a `patchwork:datatype` and a
  `patchwork:tool` that share the same id.
